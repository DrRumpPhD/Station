Glorious vending machines and posters from Space Station 13, now in Starbound! 

This is an expanded version of my previous mod, "Boda Machine." If you still have that mod installed, make sure you remove it before downloading this one! 
The old version simply -replaces- the vending machine, this one adds several unique items and objects in addition to replacing the vending machine. 

[h1]Content[/h1]
Starbound is a great game for building space stations and sci-fi stuff, but has always been sorely missing the authentic spessman content we know and love. 

Well ache no longer, this mod includes 10 unique posters from SS13, the classic BODA machine, as well as 3 new vending machines. All including drinks and beverages of course, your cheese-honker addiction is safely satiated. All items are complete with racial descriptions for maximum spess immersion! 

This mod reskins the existing vending machine to the Space Cola machine, and replaces the original sodas with a new delicious selection. 

[h1]The Autolathe[/h1]
All these items are printed on the new 3D printer item, the autolathe. 
The autolathe can be created at the second tier Inventor's Table for 5 titanium bars, 5 glass, 1 gold bar and 5 copper bars. 

There is a lot of room for more content in this mod, and we may add more stuff in the future, so keep posted.",
